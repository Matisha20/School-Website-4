                <img src="projector.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
              <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The new projector makes the teacher easy to teach the students using the projector . It has been easy for the teacher and students to study and teachers just scroll on laptop and done easy it is! sometimes there and issues with it but no worries! Our school has people who can fix it. Teachers are always trying new techniques to teach their students better and cater to various learning styles. Each student has a unique way of learning, making it tricky for teachers to accommodate each individual in the classroom when they have a set curriculum they need to meet.

                Projectors can help teachers better meet the needs of their students by displaying information differently. Like with chalkboards and whiteboards, teachers can still provide visual aids to accompany their verbal points. However, they can also add images and videos, helping further clarify new or unfamiliar concepts across disciplines.
                
                Auditory learners can still listen to lectures, but they have learning opportunities with the extra content teachers can share on projectors. Teachers can help their students learn through music, movies, video clips and expert lectures. For example, language teachers can play music in the classroom while projecting the lyrics onto the screen, helping connect sounds and vocabulary for stronger language skills.Pairing an education projector with a touch screen is a great way to keep kinesthetic learners engaged. Students can have a hands-on experience with concepts, problems and activities they have to solve or complete on the board. Elementary school teachers can keep energetic students engaged by creating activities and games students can volunteer to do in front of the class.

                Projectors can help engage students with different learning speeds, as well. It can be challenging for slower learners to keep up in classes when their teachers move too quickly. They might miss vital points, setting them back. With projectors, teachers can return to slides in presentations or replay parts of videos, so slower learners can receive all the information they need to do well in their classes without holding the faster learners back.
